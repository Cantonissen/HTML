    My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married.
    I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
    I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what.
    After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.
    Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
    I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
    I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
    That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
